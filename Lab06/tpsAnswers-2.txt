tps activity 1:
1. The starting address of Text Segment is 0x00400000 and the starting address of Data segment is 0x10010000
2. Basic assembly code is a lot more lower leveled and uses more hex in the code itself
3. 32 bits
4. 8 columns
5. 4 bytes
6. m: .word 20
7. 0x10010008
8. 4
9. 0x10010008 0x1001000c 0x10010010
10. Yes because each ascii code is stored in 4 bytes blocks with null pointers
11. la $a0, str1 -> li $v0, 4 -> syscall
12. La would load address of n in register t3

tps activity 2:
1. It is redundant, it will just branch to one part of your code if the inequality is true otherwise you the code will continue in the same block.
2.
