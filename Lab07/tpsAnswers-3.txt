TPS 1:

1. A functin returns a value but a procedure does not. A method is like a function but it belongs to a specific class.
2. ok
3. made proc1.c
4. 20 and it adds two values and puts it in $v0
5. no because of register conventions you would keep jumping back to the same part
6. 11
7. It doesn't work ie crashes 
8. 0x00400020
9. The return address just changed
10. 0x00400018
11. jal
12. added jal instead of jump

TPS 2:
1. 38
2. ok
3. because sum jumps back to the $ra due to jal register we should use a stack pointer
4. return address is overwritten. use a stack pointer and store it there 
5. This is a problem because we are overwriting the $s0 register we can fix this by decrementing stack pointer by 3 bytes.
6.
